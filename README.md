# tetrs
Yet another TDD exploration in the context of game development, using Tetris as an example.

You can read an introduction to the technique [here](https://blog.wolfgangdeutsch.work/posts/outside-in-tdd-tetris-1/).

Rendering is done using the excellent [Rust bindings](https://github.com/deltaphc/raylib-rs) for the excellent [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) graphics library.

The game itself is playable but not pretty (or complete).

TDD'ing a pretty game is probably not possible. But you can TDD an ugly one and make it easy for another, more graphically inclined person, to make it pretty.

Maybe next time!

PS: Seriouly though, Raylib is AWESOME.
